            I began my singing career like most do, by singing at home. When I was a little kid I was growing up in Georgia right on Robins Air Force Base; life was good. <br>
            My mother told me I started singing when I was in my car seat, singing along to the radio. Little did anyone know at the time how singing would become such a huge part of my life.<br>

            Over the years I became a professional shower singer and was looking for the next big thing. <br>
            Cut to Middle School when I finally joined choir for the first time. It took a <b>LOT</b> of coaxing from my choir director because I thought I was <em>too cool</em> for choir.<br>
            That is when it hit, my first choir concert I realized how much singing with a group of people really moved me. Something about all of our voices uniting in song spoke to my soul, and from then on my passion for singing, particularly choral singing, was born.<br>
        </p3>
        <p4>Soon it was time for High School to start, and my best friend's Mom was our choir teacher. Sitting in the room for the first time I realized I was with a group of students who didn't seem to like choir as much as I did. <br>
            I went through the motions with the everyday warmups and learning of music until my teacher, Dr. Knobeloch, approached me to tell me I was special. She then offered me a spot in the school's top ensemble <em>Show Choir</em><br>
            At the time I didn't know much about dancing so I giggled a bit, but ultimately accepted and found myself in a room full of Juniors and Seniors with a small smattering of Sophomores. <br>
            All eyes were on me when I walked into the room for the first time, and I felt quite nervous and <em>awkward</em> seeing as I was only 15. But I found my place amongst the group and really flourished; when it was time for Musical auditions I was <em>told</em> I would be auditioning. <br>
            Much to my chagrin I made it and was the only Freshman to be in the main cast of <em>drumroll please</em>: West Side Story. That process changed my life forever and I was bit by the performing bug.<br>

            My Junior year of High School I was the only student in the school that was selected to be a part of the Honors All-State Choir festival where I would end up meeting my future College Choir Director, Dr. Brad Holmes of Millikin University. He told me "Audition for my school, and I will have a scholorship waiting for you." <br>
            I was sure he said that to all prospective students; however, when it came time to choose a college I auditioned at Millikin University, and lo and behold Dr. Brad Holmes was grinning ear to ear, and presented me with the Dean's Award in Excellence of Music, designating me as the best applicant to audition on my day. A true honor. <br>
            Being a member of the Millikin University Choir enstilled a sense of professionalism as well as teamwork. We truly relied on one another and our passion to choral excellence shined through as we were invited to tour to the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to perform 12 concerts over our 14 days visit. <br>
            I was fortunate enough to be a featured soloist while over in the Baltics, and seeing the rich history of the countries and their love for choral singing enstilled an even higher work ethic than I had before. This was the pivoting point in my career where I knew I would seek graduate studies in Vocal Performance. But where? <br>
